Test project for http://42coffeecups.com/

To run tests:

```bash
make test
```

To run Windmill tests

```bash
cd src 
python manage.py test_windmill
```

Make sure that static is collected in `static` directory (it should be in the same level as src).

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

TODO: Unify Windmill and other tests in `makefile`? Possibly with different commands.
